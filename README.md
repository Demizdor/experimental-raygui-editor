**Experimental GUI editor for [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui)**

A early prototype for a GUI Editor, it uses [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) with [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) internally.
Fits my needs well so far but it isn't really ready for realease, more like a proof of concept.

Use with care!
